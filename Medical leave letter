Dear [Mohamed Shoaib],

I am writing to inform you that I will need to take a medical leave of absence from work due to a [Briefly describe the medical issue, "Personal health issue"]. My healthcare provider has recommended that I take time off to focus on treatment and recovery.

My leave will begin on [16-09-2024], and I anticipate returning to work on or around [01-10-2024]. I will keep you updated on my progress and provide any necessary documentation from my healthcare provider as required.

Please let me know if there are any additional arrangements or information required to ensure continuity in my absence. I appreciate your understanding and support during this time.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Shaik Nazaruddin].
